RASSEGNA BIBLIOGRAFICA
Following the introduction comes a series of textual notes concerning the
manuscript itself and previous editions of the comedy. Here the editor gives
a detailed description of the manuscript, explaining its origin and history.
The discussion of earlier editions of La Venexiana and the footnotes to the
text are marked by a ferociously polemical stance, particularly against Lova-
rini, involving numerous unjustified and at times unfounded criticisms. This
polemical attitude is represented by Padoan’s choice of the spelling of the
title of the comedy: La Veniexiana, which is of course in direct conflict with
the traditional spelling: La Venexiana. In fact, although Padoan declares
that he has remained strictly faithful to the manuscript, its frontispiece offers
a third version : La Veniexana. And sure enough in the body of the text,
although the adjective form does not occur, the name Venice, pronounced by
Venetian characters, is always '"Veniexa", printed “Veniesa" in this version.
At numerous points Padoan criticizes Lovarini’s editorial decisions, failing
to realize that he himself commits major gaffes. He extends the use of the
sedilia, which in the text is limited to some fortis c's before palatal glides, to
all c s before front vowels, and converts x’s to s’s, thus ignoring two major
issues in Venetian philology. At other points he also "corrects" the manu-
script reading drastically without regard to the linguistic and philological im-
plications. In one instance a ms. chachar is printed cagar (the question here
is not the graphy h but voicing of c to g). Padoan also complains of Lova-
rini’s addition of highly personally interpreted stage instructions, ignoring the
fact that he is guilty of same, although having the discretion to banish them
to the footnotes. In view of these points, the current editor would do well
to dispense with the gratuitously facetious tone of his criticisms and self-cita-
tions (« E ora in preparazione una nuova edizione, notevolmente migliorata,
a cura di G. Padoan »).
In other instances Padoan makes a major fuss over what is really a hair-
splitting issue. Any play, especially one written in faraway times and repre-
sented by a single, corrupt manuscript, will present numerous obscure passa-
ges; and to attack with such bile one scholar’s subjective interpretation and
then substitute it with one’s own is fruidess. Especially when on a healthy
number of points an informed reader might tend to side with Lovarini.
In the polemic over the two possible forms Act III, line 136 « Chi batte
là, Nena? » (Lovarini) and « Chi batte, la Nena? » (Padoan), given that this
would be the only instance of a personal feminine name used with the article,
the earlier version would be preferable. Or the possible reading of colsi in
Bernardo’s Bergamasque (Act III, line 122): colsi = cose is not as absurd as
Prof. Padoan would make it seem. Apart from the fact that an examination
of the manuscript by this reviewer and others seemed to affirm the spelling
colsi, cf. the 1 in qulo a few lines above on the manuscript page, colsa = cosa
is present in Old Venetian and in Ruzante’s rustic Paduan (cf. Stussi’s Testi
veneziani 71.69 and Wcndriner par. 41), and this offers some evidence that it
was widespread even in the rustic areas of Veneto influence. Furthermore,
Bergamasque presents numerous instances of a word-final vowel tensing rule
which raises e to i, giving feminine plurals in -i (personi, robi, rosi, etc.),
making colsi a perfectly plausible form. One begins to suspect that Prof. Pa-
doan’s acquaintance with Bergamasque is based solely on Tiraboschi, whom
he cites late and rarely, a rather shaky foundation for belittling Lovarini’s
interpretations as “absurd”. One is dealing here with a scarcely-documented
