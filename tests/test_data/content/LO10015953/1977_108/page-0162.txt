RASSEGNA BIBLIOGRAFICA

In the section dedicated to the cultural inquadramento, Padoan depicts
the comedy as being in full harmony with many theatrical trends of the times :
a pervading realism which manifests itself in the plot and characterization of
the play (while respecting traditions such as the division into five acts and
observation of the unities-in a minute examination of the text the editor
shows to be without foundation the generally held belief that La Venexiana
strikes out in both unity of time and place), the new realism of action and
motion in the presentation itself; the choice of spoken dialects as the linguistic
vehicle rather than latinizing or tuscanizing speech; and the discarding of
the fashion of classic revivals, by then overworked and stuffy, for the use of
local setting and contemporary timing.
Also included is a suggestive study of the participation of dilettante nobles
in both the writing and presentation of theatrical productions. Here the edi-
tor reviews the influence of Pietro Aretino on Venetian cultural development
of the time; but curiously enough, neither in this section nor later in the
introduction where contemporary comedy development is treated does the
editor articulate the numerous and striking parallels between this comedy and
the work of Ruzante (the active role of female characters, the realistic and
not yet stereo-typed use of various dialects to articulate geographical origin
and social class, the determined reaction to bembesque idealization of love,
the sympathy of the author for characters of low social status). This omission
is all the more difficult to understand in view of the active interest of Prof.
Padoan in Ruzante scholarship. Undoubtedly the introduction and the reader
would have profited greatly from a more detailed study of this interesting
connection.
Through a careful study of many details concerning customs and everyday
life, Prof. Padoan evokes a nostalgic picture of Venice in the early sixteenth
century: the festive wearing of red stockings by family servants, the dress and
adornment of Venetian women, the swarm of exotic foreigners, etc. He also
presents a seductive and well-documented hypothesis linking the principal
characters of the comedy to a Venetian family resident in the parish of San
Barnaba, although surprisingly enough this section is lacking in a discussion
of the famous class of impoverished Venetian nobles, the barnabotti. The
archival evidence presented linking the Valier family to the comedy’s characters
is certainly solid and enticing, although some of the vague textual references
induced seem forced. For instance, when Bernardo stations himself to wait
for Giulio saying that this is the route he must follow to return to his hotel,
it is rather risky to force the identification of this passage with that of the
Tolette. Although one agrees that Venetian calli are labyrinthian, the exi-
stence of numerous gondola ferries and habitual pathways of transit cannot
be ignored. And even in view of the evidence presented, Prof. Padoan’s sta-
tement that the contemporary Venetian public could think of "no other" family
than this in connection with the comedy does seem exaggerated. In linking
the characters of the play with the noble family Valier, Padoan picks up
again the thread of his discussion of the cultural and literary setting of the
time and tosses out the possibility of authorship of Giovan Francesco Valier,
although he leaves this as a tantalizing hint and stops short of affirming it.
The introduction closes with a lively résumé of the text of the comedy
in which the editor evokes the subtle and intricate development of the play
with great sensitivity.
